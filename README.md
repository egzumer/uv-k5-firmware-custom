# Open re-implementation of the Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a merge of [OneOfEleven custom firmware](https://github.com/OneOfEleven/uv-k5-firmware-custom) with [fagci spectrum analizer](https://github.com/fagci/uv-k5-firmware-fagci-mod/tree/refactor) plus my few changes.<br>
All is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found [here](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) ... a cool achievement !

> [!TIP]
> There is a work done by others on forks of this repository. I encourage you to take a look at those too. [SEE HERE](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/discussions/485)

> [!WARNING]  
> Use this firmware at your own risk (entirely). There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may even brick your radio(s), in which case, you'd need to buy another radio.
Anyway, have fun.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existent (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## User customization

You can customize the firmware by enabling/disabling various compile options, this allows
us to remove certain firmware features in order to make room in the flash for others.
You'll find the options at the top of "Makefile" ('0' = disable, '1' = enable) ..


|Build option | Description |
| --- | ---- |
|ðŸ§° **STOCK QUANSHENG FEATURES**||
| ENABLE_UART | without this you can't configure radio via PC ! |
| ENABLE_AIRCOPY | easier to just enter frequency with butts |
| ENABLE_FMRADIO | WBFM VHF broadcast band receiver |
| ENABLE_NOAA | everything NOAA (only of any use in the USA) |
| ENABLE_VOICE | want to hear voices ? |
| ENABLE_VOX | |

| ENABLE_WIDE_RX | full 18MHz to 1300MHz RX (though front-end/PA not designed for full range)|
| ENABLE_TX_WHEN_AM | allow TX (always FM) when RX is set to AM|
| ENABLE_F_CAL_MENU | enable the radios hidden frequency calibration menu |
| ENABLE_CTCSS_TAIL_PHASE_SHIFT | standard CTCSS tail phase shift rather than QS's own 55Hz tone method|

| ENABLE_REVERSE_BAT_SYMBOL | mirror the battery symbol on the status bar (+ pole on the right) |
| ENABLE_NO_CODE_SCAN_TIMEOUT | disable 32-sec CTCSS/DCS scan timeout (press exit butt instead of time-out to end scan) |
| ENABLE_AM_FIX | dynamically adjust the front end gains when in AM mode to help prevent AM demodulator saturation, ignore the on-screen RSSI level (for now) |
| ENABLE_AM_FIX_SHOW_DATA | show debug data for the AM fix |
| ENABLE_SQUELCH_MORE_SENSITIVE | make squelch levels a little bit more sensitive - I plan to let user adjust the values themselves |

| ENABLE_REDUCE_LOW_MID_TX_POWER | makes medium and low power settings even lower |
| ENABLE_BYP_RAW_DEMODULATORS | additional BYP (bypass?) and RAW demodulation options, proved not to be very useful, but it is there if you want to experiment |
| ENABLE_BLMIN_TMP_OFF | additional function for configurable buttons that toggles `BLMin` on and off wihout saving it to the EEPROM |
| ENABLE_SCAN_RANGES | scan range mode for frequency scanning, see wiki for instructions (radio operation -> frequency scanning) |

| ENABLE_SWD | only needed if using CPU's SWD port (debugging/programming) |
| ENABLE_OVERLAY | cpu FLASH stuff, not needed |
| ENABLE_LTO | reduces size of compiled firmware but might break EEPROM reads (OVERLAY will be disabled if you enable this) |

## Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

clang may be used but isn't fully supported. Resulting binaries may also be bigger.
You can get it from: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

## Building

### Github Codespace build method

This is the least demanding option as you don't have to install enything on your computer. All you need is Github account.

1. Go to https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom
1. Click green `Code` button
1. Change tab from `Local` to `Codespace`
1. Click green `Create codespace on main` button

<img src="images/codespace1.png" width=700 />

5. Open `Makefile`
1. Edit build options, save `Makefile` changes
1. Run `./compile-with-docker.sh` in terminal window
1. Open folder `compiled-firmware`
1. Right click `firmware.packed.bin`
1. Click `Download`, now you should have a firmware on your computer that you can proceed to flash on your radio. You can use [online flasher](https://egzumer.github.io/uvtools)

### Docker build method

If you have docker installed you can use [compile-with-docker.bat](./compile-with-docker.bat) (Windows) or [compile-with-docker.sh](./compile-with-docker.sh) (Linux/Mac), the output files are created in `compiled-firmware` folder. This method gives significantly smaller binaries, I've seen differences up to 1kb, so it can fit more functionalities this way. The challenge can be (or not) installing docker itself.

### Windows environment build method

1. Open windows command line and run:
    ```
    winget install -e -h git.git Python.Python.3.8 GnuWin32.Make
    winget install -e -h Arm.GnuArmEmbeddedToolchain -v "10 2021.10"
    ```
2. Close command line, open a new one and run:
    ```
    pip install --user --upgrade pip
    pip install crcmod
    mkdir c:\projects & cd /D c:/projects
    git clone https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom.git
    ```
3. From now on you can build the firmware by going to `c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom` and running `win_make.bat` or by running a command line:
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    win_make.bat
    ```
4. To reset the repository and pull new changes run (!!! it will delete all your changes !!!):
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    git reset --hard & git clean -fd & git pull
    ```

I've left some notes in the win_make.bat file to maybe help with stuff.
